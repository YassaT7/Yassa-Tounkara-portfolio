    <h2 class="about">HELLO!</h2>
    <p id="paragraph">My name is Yassa Tounkara. I was born and rasied in New York City, but  I am now living in Philidaphia. 
      I graduated in 2020 with a bachelors in Communication Studies. My last employment was for a film company as a social media coordinator. 
      I am currently learning coding, Html, Css and Javascript to be specific. While I am not coding, I like to travel and try new things, 
      I like to read, and I like to spend time with my family.  Follow along on my journey of  coding!</p>
